#PodQuest
PodQuest is a podcast player built for Fresh Air listeners. Version one allows users to view a list of all Fresh Air podcasts. Additionally, Fresh Air podcasts can be filtered by tags, date, or duration. 

I am building the PodQuest to learn more about audio players/files as well as become more comfortable making a responsive web app. 

I am building PodQuest because I am a fan of NPR’s Fresh Air and I am excited to build a tool using their content.
