#Podcast Express
Podcast Express is a podcast player built for True Story listeners. Version one will allow users to view lists of all True Story podcasts, podcasts filtered by category, or podcasts filtered by year. 
I am building the Podcast Express app to learn more about audio players/files as well as become more comfortable making a responsive web app. 
I am building Podcast Express because I am a fan of True Story and I am excited to build a tool using their content.
